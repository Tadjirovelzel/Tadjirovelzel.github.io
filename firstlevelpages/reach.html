                    <p class='stafftext teun'>I work on the intersection of art design and technology with special interest in new applications of digital technologies in public spaces.
                        This happens in many forms, namely in my own practice in design thinking, r&d and prototyping, the curation and initiation of projects such as HighLight and in the facilitation of collaborations in art and technology programmes and hackathons
                        such as Crossing Parallels and The Inventory.

                <p class='stafftext teun'>By combining these different activities in different environments I am surrounded by people that work on innovative ideas and new technologies.
                    Learning from different backgrounds and perspectives helps me to work on cross-disciplinary projects involving multiple partners.
                    I believe a lot of people, professions, technology and sectors are currently converging to create a new society that will change our way of life.

                    <p class='stafftext quinten'>Full of energy and always willing to help you with questions, I am responsible for the maintenance of 3D printers and focus mainly on improving the workspace. 
                        I also like to make sure that everyone knows as much about the machines as they can.
                        I study Electrical Engineering and have a lot of experience with 3D printing. My passions are electronics, rockets and machines.

                <p class='stafftext quinten'>I have a "just make it work" mindset. I like visualise the problem and get to work. Not only do I have experience maintaining and upgrading printers, I have also built my own 3d printer. I'm also a member of DARE. There are a lot of DARE members operating in the workspace
                    and I strive to be a bridge between the two organisations.

                <p class='stafftext tadjiro'>I studied performing arts in New York for two years. This passion of mine carried over into electrical engineering and fueled my interest in amplifier and acoustic design.

                is my favourite way to approach complex projects.
